# Development notes

Because this uses docker, vault and requires work with hostnames, this is going to be hard to test properly without a lot of mocking.  We'll update this as our strategy improves.

## Vault server for testing

We use [`vault-dev`](https://github.com/vimc/vault-dev) to bring up vault in testing mode.  You can also do this manually (e.g., to match the configuration in [`example/simple.json`](example/simple.json) by running

```
vault server -dev -dev-kv-v1
```

If you need to interact with this on the command line, use:

```
export VAULT_ADDR='http://127.0.0.1:8200'
export VAULT_TOKEN=$(cat ~/.vault-token)
```

within the hatch environment before running any commands.

## Worked example

We need to swap in the globally-findable address for alice (`alice.example.com`) for the value of the machine this is tested on:

```
mkdir -p tmp
sed "s/alice.example.com/$(hostname)/" example/local.json > tmp/privateer.json
```

Create a set of keys

```
privateer2 --path tmp keygen --all
```

You could also do this individually like

```
privateer2 --path tmp keygen alice
```

Set up the key volumes

```
privateer2 --path tmp configure alice
privateer2 --path tmp configure bob
```

Start the server, as a background process (note that if these were on different machine the `privateer2 configure <name>` step would generate the `.privateer_identity` automatically so the `--as` argument is not needed)

```
privateer2 --path tmp --as=alice server start
```

Once `alice` is running, we can test this connection from `bob`:

```
privateer2 --path tmp --as=bob check --connection
```

This command would be simpler to run if we are in the `tmp` directory, which would be the usual situation in a multi-machine setup

```
privateer2 check --connection
```

For all other commands below, you can drop the `--path` and `--as` arguments if you change directory.

Create some random data within the `data` volume (this is the one that we want to send from `bob` to `alice`)

```
docker volume create data
docker run -it --rm -v data:/data ubuntu bash -c "base64 /dev/urandom | head -c 100000 > /data/file1.txt"
```

We can now backup from `bob` to `alice` as:

```
privateer2 --path tmp --as=bob backup data
```

or see what commands you would need in order to try this yourself:

```
privateer2 --path tmp --as=bob backup data --dry-run
```

Delete the volume

```
docker volume rm data
```

We can now restore it:

```
privateer2 --path tmp --as=bob restore data
```

or see the commands to do this ourselves:

```
privateer2 --path tmp --as=bob restore data --dry-run
```

Tear down the server with

```
privateer2 --path tmp --as=alice server stop
```

## Writing tests

We use a lot of global resources, so it's easy to leave behind volumes and containers (often exited) after running tests. At best this is lazy and messy, but at worst it creates hard-to-diagnose dependencies between tests. Try and create names for auto-cleaned volumes and containers using the `managed_docker` fixture (see [`tests/conftest.py`](tests/conftest.py) for details).
